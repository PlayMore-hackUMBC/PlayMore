## Inspiration

When I first played The Last of Us Part 2, I was amazed to find a plethora of accessibility options -- some of them addressing needs I never knew existed. I thought, well, of course it's good to be able to customize your subtitles. Of course you want to change the colors for those who are colorblind. But some things really surprised. Remarkably, there were enough options allowing someone who had no vision whatsoever to play the game! I watched Twitch streamer SightlessKombat, who is blind, remark upon the fact that he could play this game with no help and how rare that was for him. Because of this, my partner and I wanted to make a website for people with disabilities, like SightlessKombat, to be able to see what accessibility options were available for each game, and to leave reviews to inform other people with disabilities about their personal experiences with these options. We hope to allow gamers with disabilities to play more games -- so we named our website Play More.


## What it does
This platform allows users to rate games based on a variety of accessibility features.

## How we built it
We utilized git extensively by leveraging feature branches and pair programing to maximize our products utility and functionality.

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into a few errors when dealing with dependency issues and some libraries are not feature complete. We also had some typescript errors which are the result of a weakly typed language.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We have our own database which stores the users reviews and will later store the users data.
We are able to query a game api for free without the issues of CORs blocking local development.
We implemented a basic search feature to add utility to the site.
We added the option to have the whole app encapsulated in a docker container. 

## What we learned
We learned how to problem solve on the fly and how to make our tools work for us.

## What's next for Play More
We plan to go on to add user authentication powered by Firebase and user profiles. These profiles will contain the reviews of the users as well as the disabilities if the user wishes to disclose them to encourage transparency and community.
